{"name":"CHService","body":"### CHService\r\n\r\nCHService is a framework for quickly and easily creating threaded, configurable MS Windows Services. \r\n\r\nCHService-derived Windows services run any number of 'worker' processes in separate threads, and can be reconfigured to add/remove/change worker processes through one line in a configuration file. Worker base classes allow simple creation of typical service archetypes, such as timed workers (fire a method every n seconds) or port listener workers (opens a socket and listens on a port for incoming connections). Applications that require a number of operations to be run in Windows services can be simplified by the creation of a library of CHService worker classes that can be easily plugged into any CHService project. \r\n\r\n### Why should I use it?\r\n\r\nCHService provides a quick and easy way to generate threaded Windows Services. Using CHService as a base, it takes little effort to create a library of configurable service worker classes that can be run in any configuration. Setting which services run, when their events are fired, and much more can all be achieved from a configuration file, making deployments and maintenance a snap. \r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nCheck out the README for a few simple steps to creating a CHService-derived Windows service Visual Studio project.
